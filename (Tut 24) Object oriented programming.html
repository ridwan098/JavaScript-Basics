<!--Objects are a special type of data that have two things: properties and methods
The PROPERTY is its characteristics and features, for example i have dark brown eyes and i have black hair. 
Whearas
the METHOD is the things it can do: for example i can code also i can playfootball-->

	
	<script type = "text/javascript">	
		var tuna = "Hey i am a tuna fish";
		
		document.write(tuna.length);
		//length is a property of tuna
		
		
		/*the document.write function is also an object.
		this is because in javascript, the white canvas, on the 
		internet that loads your code, is the document. Therefore,
		it has methods and properties. The properties would be, its colour,
		which is white, its shape, which is rectangle. This document also 
		has a method, which is "write" as it is able to write.*/
